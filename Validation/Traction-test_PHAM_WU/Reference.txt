The mechanical parameters given for the traction test (Section 3.1) are obviously wrong, since the slope of the force-displacement curve is clearly not E = 30 000 MPa.

We can deduce from Figure 6(a) that the Young's modulus is probably ≈ 6 000 MPa. Consequently, to keep \sigma_c = 3.0 MPa, the length-scale (or typically l) should be b = 0.04 mm.

Taking these parameters, we can reproduce Figure 6(a) with our code.
